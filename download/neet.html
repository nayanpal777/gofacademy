                                            it is informed that the erstwhile State of J&K had opted to stay out of the

                                            formation of UTs, the UT of J&K has been requested to consider for
                                            participation in the All India Quota. A decision is yet to be taken by the
                                            UT administration in this regard. However, the UT of Ladakh does not have
                                            any medical college. Therefore, the decision of participation of UT of J&K
                                            will be conveyed in due course.
